# Claude Progress

## Session 2026-07-06

- Goal: initialize the local project and push markdown documents to `sco11-Angus/AI-Study-Room`.
- Verified baseline: `pwd` confirmed `E:\软件\小学期实训`.
- Initial blockers found:
  - The directory was not a Git repository.
  - `feature_list.json` was missing.
  - `init.sh` was missing.
- Actions in progress:
  - Added `feature_list.json` as the feature status source of truth.
  - Added `init.sh` as the standard smoke-test entry point.
- Remaining validation:
  - Run `./init.sh`.
  - Initialize Git repository.
  - Commit markdown and project metadata files.
  - Push to GitHub.
